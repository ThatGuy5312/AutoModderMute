# 💬 GorillaCaptions
GorillaCaptions is an accessibility mod for **Gorilla Tag** that lets you see what people are saying in-game as speech bubbles above their heads. This mod is fully legal and complies with the Gorilla Tag Terms of Service.

## ❓ How does it work?
Powered with the **[QuickVosk](https://iiDk-the-actual/QuickVosk) library**, this mod gradually records voice data and runs it through a voice recognition algorithm. No data is sent to any servers, everything is running locally using [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk). No model downloading is required, everything is embedded directly into the mod.
